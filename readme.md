# Description of the project
This project is for "Games Engines 1 Assignment 2022-2023".

This project takes inspiration from the 1984 movie "Voyage of the Rock Aliens". The guitar shaped spaceship is the main aspcet and is 3D modeled and implemented in this assignment as a fully working playable guitar zooming through space! There's lavalamp integrated inside the guitar spaceship itself which moves through interacting with the guitar strings!

# Instructions for use

Open the project build and interact with the spaceship guitar strings by hovering the mouse over the strings while pressing left mouse button or by tapping for touch screens.
The "Groove Meter" value is randomly set on each interaction and determines the position of the lavalamp blob.

# How it works

The project uses a script from "Unity Metaballs" and interacts with the strings of the Guitar Spaceship. Interact with the spaceship guitar's strings by hovering the mouse over the strings while pressing left mouse button or by tapping for touch screens.
The "Groove Meter" value is randomly set on each interaction and determines the position of the lavalamp blob.

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
The project itself was such a great visit to the groovy and retro movies of the 80s. Implementing something inspired from that era was really a nice experience.

This project allowed me to make my 3D modeling skills better. I understood the "Metaballs" concept and how I can create cool looking liquid simulations using it. Moreover, implementation of the fully working interactive "Space Guitar" allowed me to enhance my grasp on programming inside Unity engine. I have more confidence built up for even more cool projects! 

# What I learned

3D modeling and UV Mapping
Programming inside Unity Engine
