# Description of the project
This project is for "Games Engines 1 Assignment 2022-2023".

This project takes inspiration from the 1984 movie "Voyage of the Rock Aliens". The guitar shaped spaceship is what is the main inspiration and is 3D modeled and implemented in this assignment as a fully workin playable guitar zooming through the space! There's lavalamp integrated inside the guitar spaceship itself which is interactable through interacting with guitar strings!

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
